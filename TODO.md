So Far

### The Good

Nice and small files.

### The Bad

* dropping down to DOM element level to do stuff is tedious
* right now there is a gap between messenger and DOM events, would be nice to make that easier to delagate
* a toggle class utility would be nice
* should we have event propagation?

### TODO

* TODOMVC - implement storage
* reproduce the Twitter layout
* how to do property binding
